## Why?

There are already a number of great tools for building decentralized apps. Blockstack provides easy-to-use libraries for using decentralized authentication with a decentralized [key-value storage system](https://github.com/blockstack/gaia).

Some apps end up running into limitations when building complex applications, though. This library aims to solve a few of those problems, such as:

- Storing and querying complex data
- Indexing data to easily query user's publicly saved data
- Collaboration with other users
- Real-time updates (in progress)

## How?

The crux of radiks is that it's built to be used with [Radiks-server](https://github.com/hstove/radiks-server), which is an indexing server for decentralized apps. Whenever a users saves or updates a model, radiks follows this process:

1. Encrypt private data on the client-side
2. Save a raw JSON version of this encrypted data in [Gaia](https://github.com/blockstack/gaia)
3. Store the encrypted data in [Radiks-server](https://github.com/hstove/radiks-server), making it easy to query in the future.

### How authorization works

Application developer's don't want users to have full control over writes to their database. Instead, users should only be able to write to data that they explicitly 'own'. To do this, Radiks creates 'signing keys', and signs all data using this signing key. The indexing server, Radiks-server, will only allow writes that are appropriately signed. [Learn more about authorization](https://github.com/hstove/radiks-server/tree/master#authorization)

## So, is it decentralized?

Although radiks applications rely on a centrally-hosted database, it is still fundamentally a decentralized application. It checks off these boxes:

- No data lock-in.
  - Because all data is also stored in Gaia, the user still controls a 'copy' of their data for as long as they need to. If the application server shuts down, the user can still access their data. It also makes it easy to backup or migrate their data at any time. [Learn more about Gaia](https://github.com/blockstack/gaia)
- Censorship resistance
  - Again, because all data is also stored in Gaia, no party can revoke access to this data at any time.
- Maximum privacy
  - Because all data is encrypted on the client side before being stored anywhere, the application host cannot inspect, sell, or use your data in any way that you don't explicitly authorize
- Built on decentralized authentication
  - Radiks is deeply tied to Blockstack authentication, which uses a blockchain and Gaia to give you full control over your user data. [Learn more about Blockstack auth](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack.js/blob/master/src/auth/README.md)

## Installation

To get started, first setup MongoDB and a radiks server. You **must** use MongoDB >3.6, because they fixed an issue with naming patterns in keys. Check out the [`radiks-server`](https://github.com/hstove/radiks-server) documentation for more information.

In your client-side code, install the `radiks` package:

~~~bash
yarn add radiks
## or
npm install --save radiks
~~~

**If you are using `blockstack.js` <=18, you must use the radiks version 0.1.\*, otherwise if you're using `blockstack.js` >=19, use radiks 0.2.\* .**

## Configuration

To set up radiks.js, you only need to configure the URL that your Radiks-server instance is running on. If you're using the pre-built Radiks server, this will be `http://localhost:1260`. If you're in production or are using a custom Radiks server, you'll need to specify exactly which URL it's available at.

Radiks also is compatible with version 19 of blockstack.js, which requires you to configure a `UserSession` object to handle all user-data-related methods. You'll need to define this and pass it to your Radiks configuration, so that Radiks can know how to fetch information about the current logged in user.

To configure radiks, use code that looks like this when starting up your application:

~~~javascript
import { UserSession, AppConfig } from 'blockstack';
import { configure } from 'radiks';

const userSession = new UserSession({
  appConfig: new AppConfig(['store_write', 'publish_data'])
})

configure({
  apiServer: 'http://my-radiks-server.com',
  userSession
});
~~~

## Authentication

Most of your code will be informed by following [Blockstack's authentication documentation](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack.js/blob/master/src/auth/README.md).

After your user logs in with Blockstack, you'll have some code to save the user's data in localStorage. You'll want to use the same `UserSession` you configured with Radiks, which can be fetched from the `getConfig` method.

~~~javascript
import { User, getConfig } from 'radiks';

const handleSignIn = () => {
  const { userSession } = getConfig();
  if (userSession.isSignInPending()) {
    await userSession.handlePendingSignIn();
    await User.createWithCurrentUser();
  }
}
~~~

Calling `User.createWithCurrentUser` will do a few things:

1. Fetch user data that Blockstack.js stores in `localStorage`
2. Save the user's public data (including their public key) in Radiks-server
3. Find or create a signing key that is used to authorize writes on behalf of this user
4. Cache the user's signing key (and any group-related signing keys) to make signatures and decryption happen quickly later on

## Models

Creating models for your application's data is where radiks truly becomes helpful. We provide a `Model` class that you can extend to easily create, save, and fetch models.

### Quick start

```javascript
import { Model, User } from 'radiks';

class Todo extends Model {
  static className = 'Todo';
  static schema = { // all fields are encrypted by default
    title: String,
    completed: Boolean,
  }
};

// after authentication:
const todo = new Todo({ title: 'Use Radiks in an app' });
await todo.save();
todo.update({
  completed: true,
});
await todo.save();

const incompleteTodos = await Todo.fetchOwnList({ // fetch todos that this user created
  completed: false
});
console.log(incompleteTodos.length); // 0
```

### Defining a model

To create a model class, first import the `Model` class from radiks. Then, create a class that extends this model, and provide a schema.

**Important**: Make sure you add a static `className` property to your class. This is used when storing and querying information. If you don't add this, radiks will default to the actual model's class name. However, in production, your code will likely be minified, and the actual class name will be different. For this reason, it's highly recommended that you define the `className` manually.

#### Schema

The first static property you'll need to define is a schema. Create a static `schema` property on your class to define it. Each `key` in this object is the name of the field. The value is whatever type you want the field to be, or you can pass some options.

If you don't want to include any options, just pass the class for that field, like `String`, `Boolean`, or `Number`.

To include options, pass an object, with a mandatory `type` field. The only supported option right now is `decrypted`. This defaults to `false`, but if you provide `true`, then this field will not be encrypted before storing data publicly. This is useful if you want to be able to query this field when fetching data.

**Important**: do not add the `decrypted` option to fields that contain sensitive user data. Remember, because this is decentralized storage, anyone can read the user's data. That's why encrypting it is so important. If you want to be able to filter sensitive data, then you should do it on the client-side, after decrypting it. A good use-case for storing decrypted fields is to store a `foreignId` that references a different model, for a "belongs-to" type of relation.

#### Defaults

Include an optional `defaults` static property to define default values for a field.

#### Example

~~~javascript
import { Model } from 'radiks';

class Person extends Model {
  static className = 'Person';

  static schema = {
    name: String,
    age: Number,
    isHuman: Boolean,
    likesDogs: {
      type: Boolean,
      decrypted: true // all users will know if this record likes dogs!
    }
  }

  static defaults = {
    likesDogs: true
  }
}
~~~

### Using models

All model instances have an `_id` attribute. If you don't pass an `_id` to the model (when constructing it), then an `_id` will be created automatically using [`uuid/v4`](https://github.com/kelektiv/node-uuid). This `_id` is used as a primary key when storing data, and would be used for fetching this model in the future.

In addition to automatically creating an `_id` attribute, radiks also creates a `createdAt` and `updatedAt` property when creating and saving models.

#### Constructing a model

To create an instance of a model, pass some attributes to the constructor of that class:

~~~javascript
const person = new Person({
  name: 'Hank',
  isHuman: false,
  likesDogs: false // just an example, I love dogs!
})
~~~

#### Fetching a model

To fetch an existing model, first construct it with a required `id` property. Then, call the `fetch()` function, which returns a promise.

~~~javascript
const person = await Person.findById('404eab3a-6ddc-4ba6-afe8-1c3fff464d44');
~~~

After calling `fetch`, radiks will automatically decrypt all encrypted fields.

#### Accessing model attributes

All attributes (other than `id`) are stored in an `attrs` property on the model.

~~~javascript
const { name, likesDogs } = person.attrs;
console.log(`Does ${name} like dogs?`, likesDogs);
~~~

#### Updating a model

To quickly update multiple attributes of a model, pass those attributes to the `update` function.

~~~javascript
const newAttributes = {
  likesDogs: false,
  age: 30
}
person.update(newAttributes)
~~~

Note that calling `update` does **not** save the model.

#### Saving a model

To save a model to Gaia and MongoDB, call the `save` function. First, it encrypts all attributes that do not have the `decrypted` option in their schema. Then, it saves a JSON representation of the model in Gaia, as well as in MongoDB. `save` returns a promise.

~~~javascript
await person.save();
~~~

#### Deleting a model

To delete a model, just call the `destroy` method on it.

~~~javascript
await person.destroy();
~~~

### Querying models

To fetch multiple records that match a certain query, use the class's `fetchList` function. This method creates an HTTP query to Radiks-server, which then queries the underlying database. Radiks-server uses the [`query-to-mongo`](https://github.com/pbatey/query-to-mongo) package to turn an HTTP query into a MongoDB query. Read the documentation for that package to learn how to do complex querying, sorting, limiting, etc.

Here are some examples:

~~~javascript
const dogHaters = await Person.fetchList({ likesDogs: false });
~~~

Or, imagine a `Task` model with a `name`, a boolean for `completed`, and an `order` attribute.

~~~javascript
class Task extends Model {
  static className = 'Task';

  static schema = {
    name: String,
    completed: {
      type: Boolean,
      decrypted: true,
    },
    order: {
      type: Number,
      decrypted: true,
    }
  }
}

const tasks = await Task.fetchList({
  completed: false,
  sort: '-order'
})
~~~

### Counting models

You can also get the count record directly.
~~~javascript
const dogHaters = await Person.count({ likesDogs: false });
// dogHaters is the count number
~~~

### Fetching models created by the current user

Use the `fetchOwnList` method to find models that were created by the current user. By using this method, you can preserve privacy, because Radiks uses a `signingKey` that only the current user knows.

```javascript
const tasks = await Task.fetchOwnList({
  completed: false
});
```

### Managing relational data

It is common for applications to have multiple different models, where some reference another. For example, imagine a task-tracking application where a user has multiple projects, and each project has multiple tasks. Here's what those models might look like:

~~~javascript
class Project extends Model {
  static className = 'Project';
  static schema = { name: String }
}

class Task extends Model {
  static className = 'Task';
  static schema = {
    name: String,
    projectId: {
      type: String,
      decrypted: true,
    }
    completed: Boolean
  }
}
~~~

Whenever you save a task, you'll want to save a reference to the project it's in:

~~~javascript
const task = new Task({
  name: 'Improve radiks documentation',
  projectId: project._id
})
await task.save();
~~~

Then, later you'll want to fetch all tasks for a certain project:

~~~javascript
const tasks = await Task.fetchList({
  projectId: project._id,
})
~~~

Radiks lets you define an `afterFetch` method, which you can use to automatically fetch child records when you fetch the parent instance.

~~~javascript
class Project extends Model {
  static className = 'Project';
  static schema = { name: String }

  async afterFetch() {
    this.tasks = await Task.fetchList({
      projectId: this.id,
    })
  }
}

const project = await Project.findById('some-id-here');
console.log(project.tasks); // will already have fetched and decrypted all related tasks
~~~

### Extending the user model

You can extend the default user model to add your own fields.

~~~javascript
import { User } from 'radiks';

// For example I want to add a public name on my user model
class MyAppUserModel extends User {
  static schema = {
    ...User.schema,
    name: {
      type: String,
      decrypted: true,
    },
  };
}
~~~

### Validating usernames

There are many situations where it is important to validate usernames that are associated with models in your app. For example, imagine a social network, where each post is tied to a specific Blockstack ID. You need to have some validation to ensure that the user who created that model is the same user who owns that Blockstack ID. Radiks can do this for you, as long as you add a special flag to your model, called `validateUsername`.

~~~javascript
class ModelWithUsername extends Model {
  static validateUsername = true
  static schema = { ... }
}
~~~

If you include this special `validateUsername` flag, then Radiks will pass on the necessar information to Radiks-server. Radiks-server will then perform some validation to ensure that model was indeed created by the username that they claim to have.

One important thing to note here is that this configuration requires you to use the `publish-data` scope when logging in with Blockstack.

## Collaboration

A key feature of Radiks is support for private collaboration between multiple users. Supporting collaboration with client-side encryption and user-owned storage can be complicated, but the patterns to implement it are generally the same for different apps. Radiks provides out-of-the box for collaboration, making it easy to build private, collaborative apps.

Radiks is built in a way that provides maximum privacy and security for collaborative groups. Radiks-server and external users have no knowledge about who is in a group.

### UserGroup Model

The key model behind a collaborative group is `UserGroup`. By default, it only has one attribute, `name`, which is encrypted. You can create multiple subclasses of `UserGroup` later on with different attributes, if you need to.

### General Workflow

The general workflow for creating a collaborative group that can share and edit encrypted models is as follows:

1. The admin of the group creates a new `UserGroup`, which acts as the 'hub' and controls the logic around inviting and removing users.
2. The admin invites one or more other users to a group:
    1. The admin specifies the username of the user they want to invite
    2. Radiks looks up the user's public key
    3. Radiks creates an 'invitation' that is encrypted with the user's public key, and contains information about the `UserGroup`
    4. When the invited user 'activates' an invitation, they create a `GroupMembership`, which they can later use to reference information (such as private keys and signing keys) related to the group.
3. Later on, members of the group can create and update models that are related to the group. These models **must** contain a reference to the group, using the attribute `userGroupId`. This allows Radiks to know which keys to use for encryption and signing.
4. The admin of the group can later remove a user from a group. They do this by creating a new private key for signing and encryption, and updating the `GroupMembership` of all users _except_ the user they just removed.
5. After a key is rotated, all new and updated models must use the new key for signing. Radiks-server validates all group-related models to ensure that they're signed with the most up-to-date key.

#### Creating a UserGroup

~~~javascript
import { UserGroup } from 'radiks';

// ...

const group = new UserGroup({ name: 'My Group Name' });
await group.create();
~~~

Calling `create` on a new `UserGroup` will create the group and activate an invitation for the creator of the group.

#### Inviting a User

Use the `makeGroupMembership` method on a `UserGroup` instance to invite a user. The only argument passed to this method is the username of the user you want to invite.

~~~javascript
import { UserGroup } from 'radiks';

const group = await UserGroup.findById(myGroupId);
const usernameToInvite = 'hankstoever.id';
const invitation = await group.makeGroupMembership(usernameToInvite);
console.log(invitation._id); // the ID used to later activate an invitation
~~~

#### Accepting an invitation

Use the `activate` method on a `GroupInvitation` instance to activate an invitation:

~~~javascript
import { GroupInvitation } from 'radiks';

const invitation = await GroupInvitation.findById(myInvitationID);
await invitation.activate();
~~~

#### Viewing all activated UserGroups for the current user

Call `UserGroup.myGroups` to fetch all groups that the current user is a member of:

~~~javascript
import { UserGroup } from 'radiks';

const groups = await UserGroup.myGroups();
~~~

#### Finding a UserGroup

Use the method `UserGroup.find(id)` when fetching a specific UserGroup. This method has extra boilerplate to handle decrypting the model, because the private keys may need to be fetched from different models.

~~~javascript
const group = await UserGroup.find('my-id-here');
~~~

## Streaming real-time changes

`Radiks-server` provides a websocket endpoint that will stream all new inserts and updates that it sees on the server. `Radiks` provides a helpful interface to poll for these changes on a model-by-model basis. For example, if you had a `Task` model, you could get real-time updates on all your tasks. This is especially useful in collaborative environments. As soon as a collaborator updates a model, you can get the change in real-time, and update your views accordingly.

Before you can implement the websocket function, you must configure your `Radiks-Server` with [express-ws](https://github.com/HenningM/express-ws)

~~~javascript
const app = express()
expressWS(app)
~~~

Here's an example for how to use the API:

~~~javascript
import Task from './models/task';

const streamCallback = (task) => {
  // this callback will be called whenever a task is created or updated.
  // `task` is an instance of `Task`, and all methods are defined on it.
  // If the user has the necessary keys to decrypt encrypted fields on the model,
  // the model will be decrypted before the callback is invoked.

  if (task.projectId === myAppsCurrentProjectPageId) {
    // update your view here with this task
  }
}

Task.addStreamListener(streamCallback)

// later on, you might want to remove the stream listener (if the
// user changes pages, for example). When calling `removeStreamListener`,
// you MUST provide the exact same callback that you used with `addStreamListener`.

Task.removeStreamListener(streamCallback)
~~~

## Saving centralized user-related data

Sometimes, you need to save some data on behalf of the user that only the server is able to see. A common use case for this is when you want to notify a user, and you need to store, for example, their email. This should be updatable only by the user, and only the server (or that user) should be able to see it. Radiks provides the `Central` API to handle this:

~~~javascript
import { Central } from 'radiks';

const key = 'UserSettings';
const value = { email: 'myemail@example.com' };
await Central.save(key, value);

const result = await Central.get(key);
console.log(result); // { email: 'myemail@example.com' }
